My javascript files
Hey it's me wowDaddy! I took this name because i have 3 wonderful kids. I love them very much. My work was fine but nothing remains good in the Turkey. So yes i went bankrupt and lost everything exept my kids thank god :) So i decided to do something. Javascript was always in my mind but did not know how to start. First i figure out freecodecamp than codecademy. Than the others. Ä° did not know how to use github.(still could not understand exactly what it is) but decided to open an account. i'm still learning english. After 3 weeks 16 hours in a day i started to understand something but still son confused about many things... i think i'm not gonna give up. I will update this text every week. So i can check myself and see the result. For now by by..
